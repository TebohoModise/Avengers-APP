<h3>"My friend, he told me that it was better to feel shitty from losing love than it is to never experience love and feel nothing at all. Feel empty. And I think he was right. Which is how I've been feeling for a long time. I push people away, kept them at a distance because of the fear of that loss, but I don't wanna do that anymore."
